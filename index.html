        <div class="custom-description">
          Komfort IQ works by collecting the most information for each workspace of a commercial office
          building.
          KIQ then uses that data for AI algorithms to optimize workspaces for comfort as well as energy
          savings.
          The building’s HVAC system is also optimized using the same data and AI algorithms based on current
          and
          future demand and current and future weather conditions. This results in improved comfort and proven
          savings of 30%+ HVAC energy savings with a payback of 1 year.</div>
        <div class="text-2">
          KIQ works in most large office buildings with VAV HVAC systems and with most BMS systems.
